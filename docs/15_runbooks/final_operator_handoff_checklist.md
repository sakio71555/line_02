# Final Operator Handoff Checklist

## Purpose

Give the operator a short checklist after Loop 157-160.

The system is reviewable, but production remains No-Go until the remaining approvals and controlled smokes are complete.

## Current Review State

```txt
https_ready_for_review=true
line_receive_ready=true
official_account_auto_response_ready=true
supabase_ready=true
supabase_receive_persistence_ready=true
openai_ready=false
line_reply_push_ready=false
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

## If OpenAI Real API Will Be Used

1. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-set-openai-runtime-secrets.sh` on the VPS.
2. Enter the OpenAI API key outside Codex.
3. Enter the OpenAI model outside Codex.
4. Decide whether one paid smoke call is approved.
5. Run the controlled smoke in a dedicated Loop.
6. Record only status and redacted readiness.

## If LINE Real Reply / Push Will Be Used

1. Confirm Official Account response message remains OFF.
2. Confirm the test recipient outside Codex.
3. Confirm the one test message outside Codex.
4. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-set-line-real-push-flag.sh` only in an approved Loop.
5. Send exactly one test message.
6. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-disable-line-real-push.sh` immediately after the test.
7. Record only status and redacted readiness.

## Final Go / No-Go Inputs

Required before promotion:

- HTTPS remains healthy.
- LINE receive remains healthy.
- Supabase persistence remains healthy.
- OpenAI is either intentionally mock or controlled smoke passed.
- LINE reply/push is either intentionally disabled or controlled smoke passed.
- Final operator Go is recorded.

## Still No-Go

```txt
supabase_write_smoke=not_performed
openai_real_api_smoke=not_performed
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
final_operator_go=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

## Secret Rule

Do not record secrets, webhook path values, LINE user identifier values, message bodies, Supabase endpoint values, DB URLs, OpenAI keys, or bearer tokens.

## Loop 161 Follow-up

```txt
openai_runtime_env=absent
openai_real_api_smoke=not_performed
openai_real_api_smoke_reason=openai_runtime_env_absent_pending_human_input
openai_ready=false
line_real_push_enabled=false
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

Next operator action for OpenAI is to provide the runtime env through the root-only helper in a dedicated Loop, then approve exactly one non-customer controlled smoke. Until then the API stays on mock AI.
