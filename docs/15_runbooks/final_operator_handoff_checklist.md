# Final Operator Handoff Checklist

## Purpose

Give the operator a short checklist after Loop 157-160.

The system is reviewable, but production remains No-Go until the remaining approvals and controlled smokes are complete.

## Current Review State

```txt
https_ready_for_review=true
line_receive_ready=true
official_account_auto_response_ready=true
supabase_ready=true
supabase_receive_persistence_ready=true
openai_ready=false
line_reply_push_ready=false
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

## If OpenAI Real API Will Be Used

1. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-set-openai-runtime-secrets.sh` on the VPS.
2. Enter the OpenAI API key outside Codex.
3. Enter the OpenAI model outside Codex.
4. Decide whether one paid smoke call is approved.
5. Run the controlled smoke in a dedicated Loop.
6. Record only status and redacted readiness.

## If LINE Real Reply / Push Will Be Used

1. Confirm Official Account response message remains OFF.
2. Confirm the test recipient outside Codex.
3. Confirm the one test message outside Codex.
4. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-set-line-real-push-flag.sh` only in an approved Loop.
5. Send exactly one test message.
6. Run `/root/bin/amami-line-disable-line-real-push.sh` immediately after the test.
7. Record only status and redacted readiness.

## Final Go / No-Go Inputs

Required before promotion:

- HTTPS remains healthy.
- LINE receive remains healthy.
- Supabase persistence remains healthy.
- OpenAI is either intentionally mock or controlled smoke passed.
- LINE reply/push is either intentionally disabled or controlled smoke passed.
- Final operator Go is recorded.

## Still No-Go

```txt
supabase_write_smoke=not_performed
openai_real_api_smoke=not_performed
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
final_operator_go=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

## Secret Rule

Do not record secrets, webhook path values, LINE user identifier values, message bodies, Supabase endpoint values, DB URLs, OpenAI keys, or bearer tokens.

## Loop 161 Follow-up

```txt
openai_runtime_env=absent
openai_real_api_smoke=not_performed
openai_real_api_smoke_reason=openai_runtime_env_absent_pending_human_input
openai_ready=false
line_real_push_enabled=false
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

Next operator action for OpenAI is to provide the runtime env through the root-only helper in a dedicated Loop, then approve exactly one non-customer controlled smoke. Until then the API stays on mock AI.

## Loop 162 Follow-up

```txt
openai_runtime_env=present; values not recorded
openai_real_api_smoke=performed_once
openai_real_api_smoke_status=failed
openai_smoke_error_class=OpenAiProviderError
openai_response_body_recorded=no
openai_api_key_recorded=no
openai_prompt_recorded=no
openai_model_value_recorded=no
openai_systemd_dropin_present_final=false
openai_ready=false
line_real_push_enabled=false
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

Next operator action for OpenAI is not another paid retry. First diagnose the sanitized provider failure without recording secrets or raw response bodies, then decide whether a second approved smoke is necessary in a separate Loop.

## Loop 163 Follow-up

```txt
openai_diagnostic_smoke=performed_once
openai_diagnostic_smoke_status=failed
openai_diagnostic_error_classification=I_unknown_sanitized
openai_key_replacement_smoke=performed_once
openai_key_replacement_smoke_status=failed
openai_key_replacement_error_classification=I_unknown_sanitized
openai_response_body_recorded=no
openai_api_key_recorded=no
openai_prompt_body_recorded=no
openai_model_value_recorded=no
openai_systemd_dropin_present_final=false
openai_ready=false
line_real_push_enabled=false
line_real_push_reply=not_performed
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

The operator replaced the OpenAI API key outside Codex, but the follow-up smoke still failed with the same sanitized unknown classification. Next operator action is not another blind retry. Use a dedicated secret-safe remediation Loop.

## Loop 164 Follow-up

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY configured; value not recorded
OPENAI_MODEL configured; value not recorded
openai_model_fallback_smoke=performed_once
openai_model_fallback_smoke_status=failed
openai_model_fallback_error_classification=I_unknown_sanitized
openai_response_body_recorded=no
openai_prompt_body_recorded=no
openai_api_key_recorded=no
openai_model_value_recorded=no
openai_systemd_dropin_present_final=false
ai_provider_final=mock
line_real_push_enabled=false
openai_ready=false
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

The model fallback smoke still failed. Do not move to LINE real reply/push until OpenAI readiness is either intentionally deferred as mock or remediated with a successful controlled smoke and separate operator approval.

## Loop 165 Follow-up

```txt
raw_responses_smoke_status=success
provider_boundary_smoke_status=failed
provider_boundary_error_classification=I_unknown_sanitized
provider_boundary_retry_performed=no
openai_response_body_recorded=no
openai_api_key_recorded=no
openai_prompt_body_recorded=no
openai_model_value_recorded=no
openai_systemd_dropin_present_final=false
ai_provider_final=mock
openai_api_connectivity_ready=true
openai_provider_runtime_ready=false
production_readiness=production_no_go
```

Next operator action is not LINE real reply/push yet. First decide whether to run a provider output contract remediation Loop and approve any future paid OpenAI smoke separately.
